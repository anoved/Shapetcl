Planning to change interface for coords & attributes commands, in
	
read/write subcommand:
	
	attributes read
	attributes read recordIndex
   (attributes read recordIndex fieldIndex)
	
	attributes write {} ### would append new record
	attributes write recordIndex {}
   (attributes write recordIndex fieldIndex {})


so instead of [coords ?index ?{}??]:

	coords read
	coords read featureIndex
	
	coords write {} ### would append new feature
	coords write featureIndex {}
	
The [attributes write {}] and [coords write {}] forms could either create
an empty complementary coords/attr, OR they could be used for the perilous
act of adding records or features without also matching the other file.
I think they should keep things in sync; either create a SHPT_NULL feature
to be overwritten or create a record full of NULL values to be overwritten.
Of course, this is if the [* write {}] form is even implemented.
